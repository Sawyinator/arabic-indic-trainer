DISCLAIMER - This project was made with heavy involvement from Google's Gemini.

WARNING - I don't have a purchased code signing certificate, so it will tell you the program is from an unknown publisher. I assure you, the only thing that is being run is a window that acts as a shell for the HTML code to be ran inside of. You can disable this warning in properties, or by booting it, selecting advanced and choosing run anyway. If you are still uncomfortable with running it, the HTML file does the *exact* same thing, just in your browser instead of an exe.
